# Hole-detection-in-sarees-using-Image-Processing
The project aims at detecting holes in sarees using OpenCV in python and NumPY. The image is taken as a NumPY array and then we convert it to greyscale, following which we apply threshold to create a pure black white image and the we use Gaussian blur to remove noise. The detection is done using blob detection.
